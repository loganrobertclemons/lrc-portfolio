#### Intro
Hi! My name is Logan and I am a Cloud Engineer with enterprise experience in the healthcare industry.
<br>
I'm interested in building cool things as well as automating less cool things. My goal as an engineer is to make my customers' lives easier by delivering performant and efficient solutions to a wide array of problems. I am based out of Nashville but I am from the DC area. I am not open to relocation at the moment, but I am interested in remote work!
<br><br>

#### Currently
I currently work for Lirio LLC ([lirio.com](https://lirio.com/about-us/)) as a Cloud Engineer. Monitoring, infrastructure development, automation, administration, etc. I have experience building infrastructure for a large scale, fortune 500 business as well as a start up. "Trying to bridge the gap between development and operations by applying a software engineering mindset to sysadmin topics." Google's words, not mine - but definitely summarizes what I consider to be my core responsibilities.
